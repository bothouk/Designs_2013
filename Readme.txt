Botho, operated by Open Optics Limited registered in England, UK, is the first and only open source eyewear brand that manufactures its products in the European Union!

We want to grow within our community and flourish by your support whilst giving back to the ones in need (more information will be disclosed soon).

Initially, our plan is to deliver the blueprints of a small number of classic designs. From there, both our desingers with the community we expect to produce exceptional designs "From You - For You". 

We simply believe that creativity and fashion are not developed behind locked design rooms. Instead we are transparent and we give the opportunity to anyone who wants to build his own eyewear using our designs, igniting the eyewear industry and changing the rules. 

On this journey we welcome advice from the experienced Open Source community so that we can improve our services and transform Botho to a pillar of Open Source Fashion.
